==================================

A collection of python packages to support various, quirky features.
These tools are intended to reduce reduncancy and complexity but mostly
-- and more importantly -- make your code more compatible. Whether
backwards-compatible with your own systems or cross-compatible with
multiple different packages or package versions.
